### ðŸ‘‹ JAVA - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
ðŸŒ¼ **OBJECT:** Object is an entity that has state and behavior e.g., car, pen, table, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system. 

**Characteristics of Object:** State (Represents the data of an object). Behavior (Represents the behavior of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc). Identity (It is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely)

ðŸŒ¼ **CLASS:** A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It canâ€™t be physical. Class in java can be fields, methods, constructors, blocks, nested class and interface. 

ðŸŒ¼ **METHOD:** A method is a way to perform some tasks. The method in Java is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task. It provides the reusability of code. 

**Types of Method:** Predefined, User-defined

**Static Method:** A method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method. We can create a static method by using the keyword static before the method name. 

**Instance Method:** It is a non-static method defined in the class. Before calling or invoking the instance method, it is necessary to create an object of its class.

**Abstract Method:** A method that does not have a method body is known as an abstract method. The class must be abstract if it has an abstract method
