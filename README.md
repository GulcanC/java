### ðŸ‘‹ JAVA - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
ðŸŒ¼ **OBJECT:** An Object is an entity that has a state and behavior, e.g., a car, a pen, a table, etc. It can be physical or logical (encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects). An example of an intangible object is the banking system. 

**Characteristics of Object:** State (Represents the data of an object). Behavior (Represents the behavior of an object, such as deposit, withdraw, etc). Identity (It is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely)

ðŸŒ¼ **CLASS:** A class is a group of objects that have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It canâ€™t be physical. Classes in Java can be fields, methods, constructors, blocks, nested classes, and interfaces. 

ðŸŒ¼ **METHOD:** A method is a way to perform some tasks. In Java, a method is a collection of instructions that perform a specific task. It provides the reusability of code. 

**Types of Method:** Predefined, User-defined

**Static Method:** A method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method. We can create a static method by using the keyword static before the method name. 

**Instance Method:** It is a non-static method defined in the class. Before calling or invoking the instance method, an object of its class must be created.

**Abstract Method:** An abstract method is a method that does not have a method body. The class must be abstract if it has an abstract method

ðŸŒ¼ **CONSTRUCTORS:** In JAVA, a constructor is a block of code similar to a method. At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in memory. There are some rules defined for the constructor: 

ðŸŒ¼ **INHERITANCE**:

ðŸŒ¼ Polymorphism

ðŸŒ¼ Abstraction

ðŸŒ¼ Encapsulation

ðŸŒ¼ **STATIC KEY WORD**: The static keyword in Java is used mainly for memory management. We can apply the static keyword to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. The static can be a variable or a method. 

ðŸŒ¼ **FOR LOOP:** The Java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iterations is fixed, it is recommended to use a for loop. 

ðŸŒ¼ **WHILE LOOP:** The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iterations is not fixed, it is recommended to use a while loop. 

ðŸŒ¼ **DO-WHILE LOOP:** The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. Use it if the number of iterations is not fixed and you must execute the loop at least once.
